# tphot

tphot (for "trailed photometry") finds and measures astronomical sources in images.  tphot was originally designed to fit trailed stars in non-sidereally tracked images, but it is just as effective when stars are not trailed but sources of interest are.

For more information, see tphot.man or Sonnett et al. (2013) at https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.5586.
